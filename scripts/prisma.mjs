/**
 * The Prisma CLI, with one variable filled in when it safely can be.
 *
 *   node scripts/prisma.mjs migrate deploy
 *   node scripts/prisma.mjs generate
 *
 * Why this exists: `schema.prisma` declares `directUrl = env("DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED")`,
 * and `prisma migrate deploy` needs that variable set even to run — it fails
 * up front with
 *
 *   Error code: P1012 — Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED
 *
 * before touching a database, which reads like a schema problem and is
 * actually a missing variable.
 *
 * `prisma generate` does NOT need it — generate only reads the schema and
 * writes a client, it opens no connection at all, and runs fine against a
 * pooled DATABASE_URL with no DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED in sight (verified: a
 * bare `prisma generate` against a pgbouncer URL and no direct one succeeds).
 * An earlier version of this script applied the check to every subcommand,
 * including generate — which meant `npm install`'s postinstall hook (plain
 * `prisma generate`, no migration in sight) failed on any host whose
 * DATABASE_URL is pooled, even though generate had nothing to complain about.
 * So the fill-in/refuse logic below runs only ahead of `migrate`.
 *
 * Two cases hide behind the migrate error and they want opposite answers:
 *
 *  - There is no pooler. DATABASE_URL is already a direct connection (a plain
 *    Postgres server, a local database, a direct Neon string). The two URLs
 *    would be identical, and demanding both is pure ceremony. We fill it in.
 *
 *  - There *is* a pooler and DATABASE_URL points at it. Copying it across
 *    would trade a clear "variable not found" for a much worse failure later:
 *    PgBouncer's transaction pooling mode does not support the session-level
 *    features migrations use, so `migrate deploy` would fail mid-run against a
 *    real database. We refuse, and say exactly what to set and where.
 *
 * The pooler is detected from the connection string itself — PgBouncer's own
 * query flag, Supabase's pooler hostname, or its pooler port. Anything else is
 * assumed direct, which is the safe assumption: if it is wrong, `migrate`
 * fails against the pooler and says so, rather than corrupting anything.
